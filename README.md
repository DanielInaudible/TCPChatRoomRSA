This task is *active* as TCPFileTransfer is done and working(linux only...)
Cant code today due to the stress of 2 jobs and school, will be back(probably) tommorow.

## TO-DO
- Decide whatever to use / not use NCURSES for UI(probably not)
- When this is done, start thingking of RSA key exchange (diffie helman). I know how it works, what it does, so i will just need to handle cases, for when a new host joins the chatroom. Will the chatroom store the keys so in the chatroom there will be encryption/decryption, or should i store all other user keys on endpoints such as clients ?(investigate later)

## DONE
- Researched multiple connections
